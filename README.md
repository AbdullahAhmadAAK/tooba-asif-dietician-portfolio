**Project Title:** Portfolio for Dietician Tooba Asif

**The Story:**

My fianc√©e wanted to reach out to more clients, but was struggling. I, being a natural problem-solver, wanted to do something other than just sitting there and listening to her, so I went ahead and prepared this for her. Initially, I got my younger brother to develop the laptop-responsive view, but after seeing his code, I decided to go all-in and build everything in a few sessions. This repo is the culmination of my efforts, built by following [Praha's Figma design screens](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1295130769939712364/nutritionist-light-theme-healthy-diet-planning-website-ui-design-template-free-editable) and customizing them as per my needs.  

You can see her existing portfolio at [tooba-asif.vercel.app](https://tooba-asif.vercel.app/). If you need any dietary services, please feel free to reach out to her on her [Instagram public profile](https://www.instagram.com/toobanutrition.co/) or on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tooba-asif-4708a72b5/) too. She's an amazing woman, a true healer, and an extremely kind person to everyone.
